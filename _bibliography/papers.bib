  abstract="Robot swarms can effectively serve a variety of sensing and inspection applications. Certain inspection tasks require a binary classification decision. This work presents an experimental setup for a surface inspection task based on vibration sensing and studies a Bayesian two-outcome decision-making algorithm in a swarm of miniaturized wheeled robots. The robots are tasked with individually inspecting and collectively classifying a {\$}{\$}1{\backslash},{\backslash}text {\{}m{\}} {\backslash}times 1{\backslash},{\backslash}text {\{}m{\}}{\$}{\$}1m{\texttimes}1mtiled surface consisting of vibrating and non-vibrating tiles based on the majority type of tiles. The robots sense vibrations using onboard IMUs and perform collision avoidance using a set of IR sensors. We develop a simulation and optimization framework leveraging the Webots robotic simulator and a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. We consider two existing information sharing strategies and propose a new one that allows the swarm to rapidly reach accurate classification decisions. We first find optimal parameters that allow efficient sampling in simulation and then evaluate our proposed strategy against the two existing ones using 100 randomized simulation and 10 real experiments. We find that our proposed method compels the swarm to make decisions at an accelerated rate, with an improvement of up to 20.52{\%} in mean decision time at only 0.78{\%} loss in accuracy.",

  abstract={Robot swarms can be tasked with a variety of automated sensing and inspection applications in aerial, aquatic, and surface environments. In this paper, we study a simplified two-outcome surface inspection task. We task a group of robots to inspect and collectively classify a 2D surface section based on a binary pattern projected on the surface. We use a decentralized Bayesian decision-making algorithm and deploy a swarm of 3-cm sized wheeled robots to inspect a randomized black and white tiled surface section of size 1mx1m in simulation. We first describe the model parameters that characterize our simulated environment, the robot swarm, and the inspection algorithm. We then employ a noise-resistant heuristic optimization scheme based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) using a fitness evaluation that combines the swarms classification decision accuracy and decision time. We use our fitness measure definition to asses the optimized parameters through 100 randomized simulations that vary surface pattern and initial robot poses. The optimized algorithm parameters show up to 55% improvement in median of fitness evaluations against an empirically chosen parameter set.},
