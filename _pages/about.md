I am a second year PhD student at the University of Southern California (USC) advised by [Professor Gaurav Sukhatme](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Sukhatme/Gaurav) with the [Robotic and Embedded Systems Lab](https://uscresl.org/) (RESL). Previously, I completed my bachelors at Princeton University studying Electrical and Computer Engineering with two minors in Applications of Computing and Robotics & Intelligence Systems. At Princeton, I studied multi robot systems in the [Self Organizing Robotics Lab](https://ssr.princeton.edu/) with [Professor Radhika Nagpal](https://www.radhikanagpal.org/) and was a visiting researcher at the University of Groningen with [Professor Bahar Haghighat](https://research.rug.nl/en/persons/bahar-haghighat). In the past, I've spent Summers building hardware and writing software as an avionics intern at [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/) and [Blue Origin](https://www.blueorigin.com/).

# research interests
I am interested and excited by robots that move. My research focus is in imagining the combination of hardware and algorithmic approaches for robotic systems deployed in space. I have experience in robotic simulation, hardware design, and implementation where I want to work towards bringing both sides closer - through novel hardware or better integrated algorithms. I currently work on applying event based vision for navigation of resource constrained robotic systems. Please reach out to me if you are interested in collaborating!
