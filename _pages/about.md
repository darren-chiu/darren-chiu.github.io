I am a first year PhD student at the University of Southern California advised by [Professor Gaurav Sukhatme](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Sukhatme/Gaurav). Previously, I completed my bachelors at Princeton University studying Electrical and Computer Engineering with two minors in Applications of Computing and Robotics & Intelligence Systems. At Princeton, I studied swarm robotics in the [Self Organizing Robotics Lab](https://ssr.princeton.edu/) and was a visiting researcher at the University of Groningen with [Professor Bahar Haghighat](https://research.rug.nl/en/persons/bahar-haghighat). In the past, I've spent Summers as an avionics intern at SpaceX and Blue Origin working in the radiation effects testing field.
